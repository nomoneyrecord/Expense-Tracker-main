## Summary

This was this first time diving into React and Node. It was super fun and very challenging to learn more about React as a declaritive language and the extensive functionality of creating modular code within componenets. 

This took me a few weeks of conistent study and experimentation, but I've gained a lot more understanding with JSX and utilizing a library that allows for more compressed as well as complex UI's that are great for developer teams and the over all user experience.
